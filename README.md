# memoryCrash

## Project Description

This project is called memoryCrash and is a simple memory game. The game allows the user to select an even number of cards to play with from 4 to 100. These cards are then displayed on the screen face down. The goal is to find all pairs of cards with matching colors by flipping over two cards at a time. The project incorporates the use of HTML, CSS, and JS to build the site and includes the following sections:
* A start screen with the game title, instructions, and a simple form consisting of a text field and a play button
* A game board that consists of the following
  * A menu at the top of the page with the game title, score board, current game progress, and a reset button
  * A game space consisting of the cards
The creation of this project allowed me to continue to develop my programming skills and learn several new topics. These topics fell into either the CSS or JS portions of the project and are listed below
* CSS
  * Animating the webpage with the use of the transition and animation properties
  * Using box-shadow, text-shadow, and the webkit-text-stroke properties to realistically mimic neon effects
  * Using the visibility and opacity properties to hide and display elements
* JS
  * Creating event listeners to complete more complex tasks such as
    * Starting/Resetting the game
    * Creating a variable amount of cards and random colors based on user input
    * Updating the game progression
    * Updating the score board while remembering previous scores
    * Use of the 'transitioned' event type to force tasks to complete after the card has flipped
  * Reinforcing best practices for modular functions

## Known Issues and Room for Improvements
* Break up the handleCard function to be more modular
* Delegate event listener for the card flip to a parent element
* Make the CSS more responsive to different user environments and higher card counts
* Improve scoring clarity
* Improve randomness of card shuffle and card color
* Make card face design more interesting and distinct
